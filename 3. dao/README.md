# DAO contract
It is great to have ability to make any decision in decentralised manner. Since everything in TON is controlled by messages it is enough for DAO-contract to be able decide on sending or not specific messages: you can control TONs, NFTs, Jettons, nominator stakes, ... everything.

Any person may suggest proposal for DAO voting. Any holder of voting rights may vote for this proposal. Once proposal gets 2/3 of total weight it gets executed. Also holders may transfer their voting powers partially or entirely to other persons.

Note, that for each request voting weights are snapshoted at the moment of proposal creation. That way it is impossible to vote from one account transfer voting power to the other and vote again.
