# DAO contract
It is great to have the ability to make any decision in a decentralized manner. Since everything in TON is controlled by messages it is enough for DAO-contract to be able to decide on sending or not specific messages: you can control TON, NFTs, Jettons, nominator stakes, ... everything.

Any person may suggest a proposal for DAO voting. Any holder of voting rights may vote for this proposal. Once the proposal gets 2/3 of the total weight, it gets executed. Also, holders may transfer their voting powers partially or entirely to other persons.

Note, that for each request, voting weights are snapshotted at the moment of proposal creation. That way, it is impossible to vote from one account to transfer voting power to the other and vote again
