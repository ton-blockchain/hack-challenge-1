# Rules

This contest is dedicated to finding vulnerabilities in smart-contracts. To be able to participate you need to have couple of TONs, know how to compose arbitrary cells (via fift/tonweb/ton3/ton(whales)/tongo/pytonlib), know how to compose internal messages and send messages to the network. It will be useful to know how to read tl-b notation.

Each contract contains major flow which allows to bypass intended and stole all funds.

During contest contracts are revealed one by one: once contract is being hacked we give 15 minute break and reveal address of the next smart-contract. Funds will be deposited to contracts shortly before revealing.

For almost all contracts their funC code will be available on reveal. Some, however, will be closed sourced: you will need to disassemble them via tonwhales.com/tonscan.org/ton.cx
