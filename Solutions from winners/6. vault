1. Vault should send reward if the op is not the op_not_winner and the message is from the database.
2. Vault does not have bounce handler
3. Vault can proxy message to database if user sends “check”
4. In database we can set msg_addr_none  as an award address cause load_msg_address allows it 
5. We are requesting check from vault, database tries to parse msg_addr_none using parse_std_addr and fails
6. Message bounces to the vault from database and the op is not op_not_winner
