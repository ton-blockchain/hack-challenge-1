**Note, it seems that winner used other strategy to solve this task.** Below is *our* solution.

The problem with bank is that approach used to “preserve” money from stealing is not working instantly: instead it sends message which will be somewhat later received by bank. So if withdraw request will reach bank while all money is on the fly, bank will be insolvent during request processing. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that when bank is insolvent it sends all money to last withdrawer and self-destructs.
As a result to hack the bank one need to
1. deposit money into bank
2. send two close requests for withdrawal: the easiest way is to send two messages in one transaction via wallet-v2/v3 (it supports sending up to 4 messages in one tx, however some manual scripting is required)
3. redeploy bank with empty user accounts table
4. deposit small sum and withdraw all "unowned" money
